# Final Machine Learning Project – Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success
📌 Project Description
This project analyzes a real-world educational dataset to predict student dropout and academic success, using historical academic and demographic data. The dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, as required by the course.

We applied a comprehensive data science pipeline: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation. Several predictive models were compared in terms of accuracy, interpretability, novelty and implementation cost.
